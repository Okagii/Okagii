In the liminal hush, where echoes tread,
A quiver of thought, a needle’s thread.
Shadows waltz in twilight’s gleam,
Where lucid dreams and doubts convene.

A flicker strong, then falter brief,
A pendulum swings ‘twixt joy and grief.
Through woven veils of night and day,
Ephemeral truths begin to fray.

Whispers coil in spiral trace,
Faint murmurs lost in endless space.
Yet through the labyrinth, I wade,
Where silence speaks, and storms cascade.

Embrace the tempest, let it rend,
Each fracture yields a means to mend.
For in the eye of chaos, blind,
A tethered heart seeks peace to find.
