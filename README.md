Hello, my name is Okagi/Tota, usually my friends call me Okagi. But whatever, any nicknames are fine. Except if it's for making fun of me.
Any pronouns! Idm/idc.
I have Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) which can affect how I respond. I might need some extra space or time to process things, so please interact with me cautiously and kindly. Your understanding means a lot.
I like PJSK, Genshin Impact, Honkai Star-rail, Roblox, Danganronpa, Black Butler, my friends, and more (You can ask about it if you want, Idm.)
I really like Toya <3
